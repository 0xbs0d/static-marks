# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/darekkay/static-marks/issues/new) or [email](mailto:hello@darekkay.com).

The frontend part of Static Mark is maintained in [another repository](https://github.com/darekkay/static-marks-app), where a template file (`_template.html`) is being generated. This approach makes it possible to include the whole application and user-defined bookmarks in a single HTML file.

If you want to provide any frontend-related changes, please create a PR in the other repository. Changes to the core CLI application are handled here instead.
